          atomically (no other changes to the image while the fill is
          happening), all variations produce the same results. But the order in
          which pixels are found and filled depends on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The data structure used for the <dfn>fringe</dfn>&hairsp;: the
            collection of
            <a class="external"
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)"
               title="Vertex (graph theory) - Wikipedia">nodes</a>
            (pixel locations) that have been discovered but are
            not yet filled. This is most often a
            <a class="external"

               title="Stack (abstract data type) - Wikipedia">stack</a>
            (last-in, first-out) or
            <a class="external"
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)"
               title="Queue (abstract data type) - Wikipedia">&ldquo;queue&rdquo;</a>
            (first-in, first-out), but any kind of generalized queue will work.
            <b>See <a href="#fills">Fills</a>.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The order in which neighboring

               title="Vertex (graph theory) - Wikipedia">nodes</a>
            (pixel locations) that may need to be filled are checked and added
            to the fringe. This is especially significant when a
            <a class="external"
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)"
               title="Stack (abstract data type) - Wikipedia">stack</a>
            is used for the fringe, because with a stack, many steps often
            progress between when a node (pixel location) is added to the
            fringe and when it is actually colored. <b>See
            <a href="#neighbor-enumeration-strategies">Neighbor Enumeration

        </ul>
        <p>
          This is an early version, perhaps even a prototype for a different
          design. Fill type and configuration can only be specified through
          shortcuts, not menus. Besides fixing that, other accessibility
          improvements should be made: at minimum, it should be no harder to
          use without a mouse (or limited mousing) than popular raster graphics
          editors. This also only runs on Windows, which is not ideal.

          Most of the different fills&mdash;<a href="#stack">stack</a>,
          <a href="#queue">queue</a>, <a href="#random">random</a>, and
          <a href="#deque">deque</a> fill&mdash;are implemented the same way in
          terms of an abstract <em>fringe</em> data type, and the difference
          between them is how that type is implemented. Specifically, the
          difference is due to the behavior of the extraction operation, which
          determines the order in which
          <a class="external"

          in which they are put in, see

          Strategies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, <a href="#recursive">recursive fill</a> does not use an
          explicit fringe data structure, and <a href="#instant">instant
          fill</a> completes immediately (rather than animating over time) so
          it doesn&rsquo;t matter (for using the program) how it is
          implemented.

          <p>
            For consecutively inserted locations, extraction is in reverse
            order of insertion. This produces visible behavior that some people
            find unintuitive: since the
            <a href="#neighbor-enumeration-strategies">order in which neighbors
            are enumerated</a> is the reverse of the order in which they are
            visited,
            <abbr title="&#129092; &#129094; &#129093; &#129095; (left, right, up, down)">LRUD</abbr>
            goes down and up (when it can) before it goes right and left.
          </p>
          <p>
            This corresponds to the need, when converting a recursive
            left-to-right depth-first binary-tree traversal to use iteration
            instead (in the usual way), to push each node&rsquo;s right child
            to the fringe (which is a stack) before its left child. See

            The word &ldquo;queue&rdquo; has two common meanings. In the broad
            sense, a queue is any data structure that supports insertion as
            well as extraction of inserted elements. (It is in this sense that
            a
            <a class="external wide"
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue"
               title="Priority queue - Wikipedia">priority queue</a>
            is a queue.) In that sense, all the data types used as fringes, in
            this program or any program, are queues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here I mean &ldquo;queue&rdquo; in the narrow sense: a
            <a class="external"

            Picking randomly between the front and back of a deque is, of
            course, <em>not</em> an operation provided by deques. Deques
            (double-ended queues) provide two extraction operations. So the
            data structure being used here as the fringe is not, strictly
            speaking, a deque, but rather is implemented, in a straightforward
            way, <em>in terms of</em> a deque.

            as with a stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recursive fill uses
            <span class="box box-orange"></span>&#8239;orange.
          </p>
          <p>
            The visible difference between recursive fill and
            <a href="#stack">stack fill</a> is that recursive fill visits each
            location&rsquo;s neighbors in the order in which the neighbors are
            enumerated, whereas stack fill visits them in the opposite order
            (since they are inserted into the fringe in the order they are
            enumerated, and thus extracted in the opposite order since the
            fringe is a stack).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus a recursive fill taking neighbors in (for example)
            <abbr title="&#129092; &#129094; &#129093; &#129095; (left, right, up, down)">LRUD</abbr>
            order has the same observable behavior as a stack fill taking
            neighbors in
            <abbr title="&#129095; &#129093; &#129094; &#129092; (down, up, right, left)">DURL</abbr>
            order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although <a href="#queue">queue fill</a> also visits neighbors in
            the order they are enumerated, its behavior is not similar to
            recursive fill (or to stack fill). In recursive fill, arbitrarily
            many other locations are visited between the neighbors. For each
            neighbor, a recursive function call is made. Like a stack fill (but
            not a queue fill), a recursive fill will sometimes even visit most
            of the remaining region to be filled before it gets back to the
            next neighbor.

            The most interesting thing about recursive fill, in this program,
            is that it does not crash.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the common use case of a 1080p screen, this program creates a
            600&times;600 canvas. (At higher resolutions, the canvas is
            larger.)
          </p>
          <p>
            With most languages and implementations/environments, unbounded
            recursion risks overflowing the
            <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack"
               title="Call stack - Wikipedia">call stack</a>
            and crashing (if you&rsquo;re lucky) or otherwise behaving
            erratically, and this is a major source of security
            vulnerabilities. So while recursion has many good practical uses,
            including in some graph traversal problems, recursive flood fill is
            mostly good only for demonstration and some testing purposes.
            Common image sizes are too large for recursive flood fills to work,
            except when the region being filled happens to be small.

            C# (with that or other framework implementations) is no exception
            to this: the call stack is strictly limited and non-expanding at
            runtime. The runtime can usually detect the stack overflow and

            is not a solution, since even in languages that guarantee it in all
            eligible cases, it can only apply to the the call that visits the
            last neighbor enumerated. (C# never guarantees it anyway.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Some environments allow the call-stack size to be increased for a
            program, either before the program is run or while it is running.
            This may be a valuable solution for some non-trivial cases, but it
            is not a general solution if very large images must be supported.
            It is also not the solution used here.

            broken up into pieces, which are performed with intervening delays
            so you can see the fills being gradually applied, and which are
            interleaved with one another (and other operations that maintain UI
            responsiveness).

            A recursive algorithm implemented in continuation-passing style
            (unless all its recursive calls are tail calls) carries data
            corresponding to a call stack if it were implemented in direct
            style. The continuation comprises this structure together with
            information about what step to resume at (the &ldquo;state&rdquo;

            than being broken up into pieces separated by delays, and the

            This is quite different from the other fills. It should be really
            be viewed as a drawing command, since it does not visualize the
            behavior of a fill. It has the same behavior as the bucket tool in
            a raster graphics editor: a connected region of one color is
            immediately changed to have another color.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is really <em>atomic</em> rather than <em>instant</em>, but it
            should appear to complete immediately. No other changes happen to
            the canvas between when it starts and ends. The intermediate state
            is not even observed during it.

            The choice of algorithm, data structure, and neighbor enumeration
            order is thus an implementation detail that does not affect any
            observable behavior. As of this writing, it happens to be a flood

            Neighbors are always enumerated in the same order. The sub-strategy
            determines which order that is. There are 24 sub-strategies, since
            that&rsquo;s how many permutations of Left, Right, Up, and Down
            there are.

            performed. This is thus the same as using the

            Each time neighbors are enumerated, even within the same fill, the

            times, even in the same fill (which is possible in the case of
            concurrent <em>physically nested</em> fills interfering with each
            other), a different order may be chosen.

            Each pixel in the image has an order in which its neighbors are
            always enumerated, and each order is randomly determined
            separately. If the same pixel is reached multiple times, even in
            separate fills (whether or not they overlap in time), its neighbors
            are enumerated in that order each time. Restarting the program
            generates a different order. Without looking closely, you
            won&rsquo;t notice the difference between this and

              Microsoft.Web.WebView2 is a library that exposes the WebView2
              control for use by .NET programs, but it is not itself that
              control. This is to say Microsoft.Web.WebView2 is only a
              <em>binding</em> for the WebView2 control. I do not claim that
              the WebView2 control is itself available under the license shown
              above, which I don&rsquo;t believe to be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flood does not require the WebView2 control, but it does require
              the Microsoft.Web.WebView2 library even in the absence of the
              WebView2 control. (The mechanism Flood uses to check if the
              WebView2 control is present uses that library.)

copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
-------------------------------

PREAMBLE
This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
the fonts.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as received under this licence.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
a new environment.

"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
copyright ownership of the Font Software.

"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
rights are reserved.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
the below conditions:

1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.

2) The font name complies with the following:
(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
the new work, appended to that name.

3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
their explicit written permission.

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
licence.

TERMINATION
This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
